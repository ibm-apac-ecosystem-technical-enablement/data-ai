The three watsonx AI assistants are: watsonx Assistant, \nwatsonx Orchestrate, watsonx Code Assistant. \n \nHow can watsonx can help my business? \nWatsonx has been a game-changer for IBM's clients and partners, allowing them to \nscale and accelerate the impact of AI in their businesses with trusted data and \ngovernance. It's no surprise that companies in virtually every industry are turning to AI \nto enhance productivity and cut costs. With watsonx, businesses can rest assured that \nthey have the support they need to succeed in the ever-changing world of AI. \n \nMany enterprises are achieving higher productivity by transforming their workflows into \nsimpler, automated processes with the help of AI. To make this possible, IBM is \ncollaborating with companies to apply AI in various areas, such as: \n \n\u2022 enhancing internal audit and compliance processes,  \n\u2022 optimizing cloud IT environments (resulting in a 75 percent reduction in \ninfrastructure refresh costs),  \n\u2022 automating hundreds of thousands of call center responses with over 90 percent \naccuracy and increased client satisfaction,  \n\u2022 enhancing cybersecurity to prevent real-time attacks from criminals, and  \n   \n \n   \n \n\u2022 adding digital labor to finance, accounting, and HR teams to automate labor-\nintensive, data-entry tasks and save thousands of hours. \n \nHow will the 3 x\u2019s work together from a technical POV? \nWatsonx products are built on the common watsonx platform. This platform is built on \nOpenShift, establishes a common UI/UX, allows for common connectivity and product \nintegration.  \n \nWhat prompted IBM to rename/rebrand segments of its AI portfolio? \nWe\u2019re at an exciting inflection point for AI. AI adoption among businesses is increasing, \nand we are seeing much more interest from businesses using AI to boost productivity \nand reduce costs.  \n \nWatsonx gives new focus and brand identity to the IBM AI and data platform across our \nentire portfolio, featuring the latest generation of AI development, data management, AI \nand data governance capabilities. This enhances our ability to clearly communicate the \nplatform's value and unique differentiation to our existing and future clients. \n \nWhat clouds and locations will be covered for watsonx? \nWatsonx is an AI and data platform that aligns with IBM\u2019s Hybrid Cloud platform and will \nbe supported on-premises and on any cloud. Initially, it will be available on the IBM \nCloud, with broader deployment support to follow. \n \nWhat are the availability dates for the components of watsonx?  \n\u2022 Watsonx.ai will be available only on IBM Cloud initially in 3Q23 (July). \n\u2022 Watsonx.data will be available on IBM Cloud and AWS in 3Q23 (July).  \n\u2022 Watsonx.governance will be available only on IBM Cloud initially in 4Q23 \n(November). \n \nFor more information on data center region availability, please review the IBM SW Cloud \nProvider Roadmap in Seismic (page 10). \n \nWhat is the roadmap to provision watsonx on AWS and Azure? \nOur initial release is on IBM Cloud; we will then aggressively move to AWS and finally \nAzure. \n \nPlease refer to the watsonx roadmap on Seismic for the latest. \n \nWill there be any constraints using watsonx products in the local language?  \nLocal language is not part of the GA. We expect local languages to be available in the \nfuture. \n   \n \n   \n \n \nDoes watsonx run on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)? \nWatsonx is fully aligned with our hybrid cloud software strategy and runs on OpenShift \nContainer Platform. \n \nHow will the watsonx subscription be structured?  \nThe watsonx subscription will allow you to provision and use watsonx.data, watsonx.ai \nand watsonx.governance. Technically, the subscription will allow you to install and \nprovision any service in the cloud catalog. Shortly after GA, the subscription will be \nrestricted to just the three core watsonx services. \n \nWhat is the roadmap for other languages? \nThere are 5 languages targeted for multilingual models: Spanish, French, German, \nJapanese, Portuguese.  The timeline for delivery is TBD at the moment. \nFor more detail, refer to the watsonx roadmap. \n \nDoes watsonx have Federal Certification? \nFedRAMP for SaaS for watsonx.ai / .data / .gov is currently not in plan for 2023-2024. \n  \nIn the interim, on-prem / workaround for teams selling into USG / Federal are as follows: \n\u2022 For watsonx.data \u2013 FIPS tolerant targeted to be available on-prem / containerized \nSW in 3Q2023. Fed clients will need to deploy .data in an environment that meets \ntheir needs. \n\u2022 For watsonx.ai \u2013 FISMA is targeted to be available on-prem / containerized for Q1 \n2024. \n\u2022 For watsonx.governance \u2013 is targeted to be available on-prem / containerized for \nH1 2024. \n \nWhat data management practices and technologies does IBM deploy to help clients \ndevelop enterprise-ready models and mitigate the risk of bias in model output?  \nIBM\u2019s watsonx AI and data platform has an end-to-end process for building and testing \nfoundation models and generative AI \u2013 starting with data collection and ending in \ncontrol points for tracking the responsible deployments of models and applications \u2013 \nfocused on governance, risk assessment, bias mitigation, and compliance. The watsonx \nplatform enables clients to search for and remove duplication that improves the quality \nof output and use filtering and scoring technologies to decrease the chance that a \nsystem will include copyrighted material in the output.  IBM also puts thorough rigor into \nthe development and testing of its foundation models, with contractual protections for \nIBM-developed generative AI products and models. As one of the first companies to \ndevelop enterprise AI, IBM\u2019s approach to AI development is guided by core principles \ngrounded in commitments to trust and transparency. Given the rapidly changing \n   \n \n   \n \ngenerative AI technology landscape, our end-to-end process will continuously evolve \nand improve.  \n \n \n \n\uf0de Cloud Pak for Data - watsonx relationship \n \nHow is watsonx different from Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D)? \nWatsonx is our AI & data platform, focused on AI builders, consuming data assets to \nbuild machine learning (ML) and generative AI applications. Cloud Pak for Data is a \ntechnology platform that uses a data fabric architecture, allowing data producers to \nunderstand and organize their data. Cloud Pak for Data will continue to support the data \nfabric architecture and enable data to be served up to watsonx, and power the next \ngeneration of ML and AI applications. You can\u2019t build AI without training data. \n \nIs watsonx available as a Cloud Pak for Data cartridge? \nGenerally, the watsonx subscription is a separate offering from Cloud Pak for Data, and \nis not an add-on to it. Although it shares some common core technologies at the \nOpenShift Container Platform level, it is available as a separate offering to serve the \nneeds of our AI clients.  \n \nIBM watsonx.data will be available at GA as SaaS, and also as a cartridge on Cloud Pak \nfor Data. \n \nWhen do we sell Cloud Pak for Data as opposed to watsonx? \nCloud Pak for Data is our integrated data fabric capability, serving key use cases such as \ndata integration and data governance, allowing deployment of certain cartridges to \nextend its basic functionality. Watsonx is focused on AI builders. When clients have an \nAI-focused use case, watsonx should be the leading product. \n \nWhat is the future of Cloud Pak for Data as a Service? \nWe will announce a new watsonx subscription that can be used with the AI services that \nare part of watsonx, i.e., Watson Studio, Watson Machine Learning, OpenScale, as well \nas new services and capabilities such as watsonx.data. For all other non-AI services, \nthey will continue under Cloud Pak for Data as a Service subscription. Over time, we will \nreview and enhance this subscription. \n \nWill we have cartridges for watsonx like we do for Cloud Pak for Data? \nNone are planned now for watsonx as a whole. Watsonx.data is available as cartridge on \nCloud Pak for Data. \n \n   \n \n   \n \nWhat is the co-existence strategy for Cloud Pak for Data and watsonx over the longer \nterm? \nCloud Pak for Data provides our data fabric foundation and helps clients collect and \nunderstand their data. Watsonx is complementary to Cloud Pak for Data by allowing \nclients to use the collected data for building AI applications. \n \nHow are the watsonx platform and Cloud Pak for Data platform connected? \nThe watsonx platform is integrated with the Cloud Pak for Data platform so that current \nusers of Cloud Pak for Data utilize existing OpenShift clusters for watsonx deployments. \nAlthough the platforms are distinct in UI/UX and product capability, the underlying \ninfrastructure is utilized in a common way. \n \nHow will watsonx and Cloud Pak for Data software be sold together? \nSoftware options will be sold concurrently. Perpetual, subscription, and monthly part \nnumbers will be available for watsonx.data, watsonx.governance and watsonx.ai. For \nclients seeking services available in Cloud Pak for Data and Cartridges, we will maintain \nthe existing parts for sale and renewal. \n \nHow will watsonx impact Embeddable AI? \nThe mission of Embeddable AI is to drive adoption of IBM\u2019s AI technologies through \nISVs such as SAP, Adobe, Salesforce, etc. Our strategy has been to position a focused \nsubset of our software portfolio as Embeddable AI. Nothing changes on this front. In \naddition to existing products/libraries/APIs, a subset of watsonx (e.g., fine tuning, \ninference) will be positioned to accelerate our foundation model adoption by ISVs. We \nwill leverage standard commercial terms for watsonx at GA. \n \n\uf0de Data Fabric - watsonx relationship \n \nWhat happened to data fabric? \nData fabric continues to be an essential underpinning of our clients\u2019 data foundation. We \ncontinue to see significant adoption of our data fabric based on Cloud Pak for Data. \nEstablishing a data fabric is a key step in our clients\u2019 journeys to deploy effective and \nresponsible AI. It allows them to catalog and understand all the enterprise data they \nneed for model training tasks.  \n \nWhat happened to the AI Governance use case from data fabric? \nAI Governance is a critical component of watsonx. All features of AI Governance will \ncome to watsonx over the ensuing months, including but not limited to the governance \nof foundation models (FMs). In short, you can think of watsonx.governance as \"AI \nGovernance ++\". \n \n   \n \n   \n \nI am confused on how watsonx.governance is different from AI Governance? \nWe are early to market with our AI Governance offering, when our competitors are still \nstruggling to explain it. In fact, many vendors have no answer to this question, which \ngives IBM an opportunity to differentiate and get our clients\u2019 AI into production. At \nlaunch in Q4, watsonx.governance will extend our existing AI Governance capabilities \nwith support for foundation models and generative AI. \n \nAre there any changes to the existing AI Governance narrative and messaging, \nimpacting sales motion? \nSales motions for AI Governance will continue normally. We encourage sellers to \nleverage the importance of AI explainability, transparency, fairness, and validation to \ngenerate discussions and position the AI Governance bundle. The AI Governance \nBundle and the AI Governance Express Bundle (for AI sellers) should be positioned to \nclients interested in watsonx.governance components. Also, as usual, these components \nwill be available as separate services both on-premises and on the cloud. An upgrade \npath will be made available to clients that purchase any AI Governance components \ntoday and wish to leverage the increased capabilities of watsonx.governance. \n \nDoes watsonx.governance include data governance? \nData governance and watsonx.governance are two separate offerings with different \nvalue differentiators. \n \n \n\uf0de IBM Watson - watsonx relationship \n \nHow is watsonx different from IBM Watson and what does the rebrand mean for the \nfuture of Watson technologies? \nWatsonx is an enterprise-ready AI toolset that uses trusted data and accelerates the \nbuilding, deploying and governance of both machine learning AI models as well as the \nemerging category of foundation models for generative AI. Watson is the brand of IBM \nproducts that unlock new productivity levels by empowering individuals to make better \ndecisions and deliver faster outcomes with AI and automation.  These capabilities, used \nby individuals and teams, are collectively called digital labor. \n \nThe AI capabilities of Watson products are built on watsonx, IBM\u2019s AI and data platform \nthat enables IBM clients and partners to scale and accelerate the business impact of AI \nwith trusted data and governance. Introducing IBM\u2019s AI and data platform as watsonx \nfurther demonstrates IBM\u2019s commitment to continuing its leadership in AI for business \nthat began with the introduction of Watson technology in 2011. \n \n   \n \n   \n \nwatsonx.ai Specific Questions \n \n\uf0de General \n \nWhat is watsonx.ai? \nWatsonx.ai is the next-generation enterprise studio for AI builders. It combines \ntraditional machine learning and new generative AI capabilities powered by foundation \nmodels into a powerful platform that enables you to build AI applications in a fraction of \nthe time with a fraction of the data.  \n \nTraditional AI tools, while powerful, can be expensive, time-consuming, and challenging \nto use. Data must be laboriously collected, curated, and labeled with task-specific \nannotations to train AI models. Up until now, building a model required specialized, \nhard-to-find skills \u2014 and each new task required repeating this process.  \n \nThe introduction of foundation models provides a powerful and versatile foundation for a \nvariety of AI applications. Clients can use foundation models to quickly perform tasks \nwith limited annotated data and minimal effort; in some cases, users need only describe \nthe task to coax the model into solving it. IBM\u2019s new watsonx.ai studio offers a suite of \nfoundation models aimed at delivering enterprise value. They\u2019ve been incorporated into \na range of IBM products that will be made available to IBM clients in the coming \nmonths.  \n \nWhat services/products are represented by watsonx.ai? What are the product \ncomponents underneath watsonx.ai? \nWatson Studio, Watson Machine Learning, and the new generative AI. \n \nWhat is the connection between watsonx.ai and Watson Studio? \nWatson Studio provides the Machine Learning capabilities for watsonx.ai. Clients who \nwant to leverage Machine Learning and AI lifecycle capabilities other than on IBM Cloud \nwill still be able to purchase Watson Studio as they do today. However, clients who want \nto build AI with foundation models will need to buy or upgrade to an IBM Cloud SaaS \nsubscription for watsonx. \n \nWhat documentation will be available for using watsonx.ai? \nWhile the foundation model capabilities are in Tech Preview, a documentation tab will \nbe available inside the application. When watsonx.ai is released, there will be standard \ndocumentation on IBM Cloud similar to what is available today for Watson Studio and \nother cloud products. \n \n   \n \n   \n \nHow does IBM\u2019s new partnership with Hugging Face play into watsonx.ai? \nWe have a shared commitment to delivering an open ecosystem approach that allows \nclients to define the best models and architecture for their unique business needs.  IBM \nand Hugging Face help clients select the best models, train, optimize, and run at scale: \nIBM provides security and support while clients get the flexibility provided by Hugging \nFace tools and open source. Together we build a better community through \ncollaboration on open-source software for foundation models.  This partnership will \nallow our clients to innovate faster! \n \nWatsonx.ai will support the use of any open-source models hosted on Hugging Face. \nAlso, IBM plans to make some of its own smaller models available on the Hugging Face \nplatform for open-source use.  \n \nHow are the generative AI capabilities in watsonx.ai different from other generative \nchatbots (ChatGPT etc.)? \nWatsonx.ai is not a chatbot like ChatGPT. It is an enterprise studio for AI builders with \nthe tools and runtimes needed to train, validate, tune and deploy traditional machine \nlearning and new generation foundation models for prescriptive, predictive and \ngenerative AI tasks. It includes IBM foundation models that have been trained with one \nof the largest enterprise-relevant data sets, carefully vetted by IBM. \n \nWhen will the tuning studio be available to use? \nIt will be available in 2H 2023. For more detail, refer to the watsonx roadmap and \nwatsonx.ai model roadmap on Seismic for the latest. \n \nWhen will Prompt Tuning be available? \nPrompt tuning via the Prompt Lab interface is on the roadmap. It is scheduled to reach \ntech preview in early Q3.  Afterwards, it will be prioritized for production. ETA is to be \ndetermined. For more detail, please refer to the watsonx roadmap and watsonx.ai model \nroadmap on Seismic for the latest. \n \n \nIs there a way for clients to test watsonx.ai ?  \nWe offer a free trial to clients who want to test our AI studio at a small scale for 30 days. \nBesides that, we connect clients in a programmatic approach with our Client \nEngineering, Sales and Consulting teams to evaluate best options for Generative AI use, \nreflected in the AI Sales framework . \n \nWhere can I learn more about watsonx.ai? \nStart here in Seismic. \n \n   \n \n   \n \n\uf0de GTM \n \nWhen will watsonx.ai be available to clients? \nThe current GA target is early Q3. Pricing details will be announced at that time. \n \nFor more detail, please refer to the watsonx roadmap and watsonx.ai model roadmap on \nSeismic for the latest. \n \nHow will clients buy watsonx.ai? \nInitially, watsonx.ai will be available as a SaaS offering on IBM Cloud only. It will include \nend-to-end tools to leverage foundation models as well as existing Watson Studio \ncapabilities. In 2024, the same set of features will be made available on-premises, \nmulti-cloud deployments and on AWS.  \n \nWhen can my clients start using watsonx.ai? \nThere is a Tech Preview Program administered by the Client Engineering team.  Learn \nmore about the program here. The Tech Preview currently features the foundation \nmodel library, prompt lab and APIs (note: tuning studio will be deployed to the Tech \nPreview server soon). Space in the program is limited. If you have a client with a use \ncase, please fill out the application and the Client Engineering team will reach out.  The \nofficial GA of watsonx.ai is currently targeted for early Q3. I It will also include all the \ngreat Machine Learning capabilities of Watson Studio. \n \nWhat are migration paths for existing clients? \nAfter watsonx GA, existing clients can purchase a watsonx subscription which will allow \nthem to access to the new foundation model capabilities. On-premises, watsonx.ai  will \ninclude the existing Watson Studio and Watson ML services, with extensions delivered \nover time to those services to better support watsonx.ai's new foundation model (FM) \ncapabilities. Trade-up paths are being built to support Cloud Pak for Data \nto watsonx.ai sales motions but will not be available in 2Q. \n \nMy clients want auto-provisioning of the generative AI capabilities if they have \nentitlement to Watson Studio. When will you make that available? \nWatson Studio only provides ML features; generative AI and foundation models will not \nbe made available to Watson Studio clients by default. They will have to upgrade to \nwatsonx.ai. We are working on a client-friendly path to achieve this. \n \nWhat is the Foundation Model Tech Preview Program? \nLearn more about the program, including how to apply here.  \n \n   \n \n   \n \nHow do the foundation models we host on BAM compare against our competition (AWS, \nGOOGLE, MSFT)? \nIBM's play is to create smaller, enterprise-focused models which can sometimes \noutperform when operating \u201cin-domain\u201d or for a specific use case.  With our data \nprovenance, IBM models will have fewer risks\u2014and deployment costs.  They have also \nbeen optimized to work with our inference stack.  IBM Research will release \nperformance metrics of our models in Q3.  \n \nStrategically, it is not our intent to enter the arms race of \"build a better model.\"  We \nenvision a future where a client will select the best foundation model for a specific task \nand then bring their own data and start constructing the use case via prompt \nengineering or the tuning studio. \n \nWe are building tools to help them select the right foundation model as a starting point, \neven if it isn't a model from IBM Research. For clients who just want to get going quickly, \nwe'll have multiple models \"at the ready\" on the platform. \n \nFor more detail, checkout the watsonx.ai competitive insights asset in Seismic. \n \nWho are our competitors in this space? \nAmazon Bedrock, Azure OpenAI Service, Google Generative AI, Cohere, Nvidia, AI21, \nAnthropic, and H2O.ai.  There are others such as Databricks and Palantir but these are \nmore watsonx.data competitors who are now also dabbling in generative AI. \n \nFor more detail, checkout the watsonx.ai competitive insights asset in Seismic. \n \nWhat are our competitors doing in this space? How do we differentiate? \nMost of competitors are starting with LLM with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. \nNvidia is focused much more on image/video models.  Domain-specific areas like \nbiology and others are beginning to emerge.  No one is tackling governance in a \nmeaningful way; this aspect is still very new.  Most have a UI/API. For more detail, \ncheckout the watsonx.ai competitive insights asset in Seismic. \n \n \nMy client says they don\u2019t want to participate in a workshop. Do we have a holistic, \ninvestigative method instead?   \nPlease see the Sales Play Spotlight page on Seismic that covers the AI Sales framework, \nincluding a programmatic approach on how to assess our clients\u2019 AI readiness and how \nto engage with them via briefings, workshops, proof of value etc. here.  \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n\uf0de Packaging/Sizing \n \nWhat is the packaging/pricing structure for watsonx.ai? \nWatsonx.ai will be available as a SaaS at launch. \n\u2022 For watsonx.ai (SaaS), customers will be charged a tier fee and consumption fees.  \n\u2022 Tier Fees: The tier fee is a fixed per instance charge for access to all watsonx \nSaaS.

More details to be available later in 2H. \n \n \nWhat are the system requirements for clients to host IBM Large Language Models \n(LLM)'s?  \nFor our SaaS offering in IBM Cloud, clients won't need to host models since they will be \nhosted by IBM.  For our on-premises offering, details have not yet been published but \nwill be shortly.   \n \nWhat IBM foundation models are included in watsonx.ai? \nRecognizing that one size doesn\u2019t fit all, we\u2019re building a family of language and code \nfoundation models of different sizes and architectures. Each model family has a \ngeology-themed code name \u2014Granite, Sandstone, Obsidian, and Slate \u2014 which brings \n   \n \n   \n \ntogether cutting-edge innovations from IBM Research and the open research \ncommunity. Each model can be customized for a range of enterprise tasks.  \n \nOur Granite models are based on a decoder-only, GPT-like architecture for generative \ntasks. Sandstone models use an encoder-decoder architecture and are well suited for \nfine-tuning on specific tasks, interchangeable with T5 models. Obsidian models utilize a \nnew modular architecture developed by IBM Research, providing high inference \nefficiency and levels of performance across a variety of tasks. All watsonx.ai models are \ntrained on IBM\u2019s curated, enterprise-focused data lake, on our custom-designed cloud-\nnative AI supercomputer, Vela.  \n \nEfficiency and sustainability are core design principles for watsonx.ai. IBM Research has \ninvented new technologies for efficient model training including our \u201cLiGO\u201d algorithm \nthat recycles small models and \u201cgrows\u201d them into larger ones. This method can save \nfrom 40% to 70% of the time, cost, and carbon output required to train a model. To \nimprove inference speeds, we\u2019re leveraging our deep expertise in quantization, or \nshrinking models from 32-point floating point arithmetic to much smaller integer bit \nformats. Reducing AI model precision brings huge efficiency benefits without sacrificing \naccuracy. Our roadmap includes the ability to run these compressed models on our AI-\noptimized chip, the \u201cIBM AIU.\u201d  \n \nFm.language is a collection of enterprise-grade large language models (LLMs).  These \nmodels can drive both generative tasks (e.g., summarization) as well as traditional \nnatural language processing (NLP) tasks (e.g., classification).  These models are built on \nIBM's trusted-data repository, and were trained with IBM's highly efficient LiGO \ntechnique, making them some of the most sustainably-trained foundation models \navailable. \n \nFor more detail, please refer to the watsonx.ai model roadmap on Seismic for the latest. \n \nWhat traditional Machine Learning models are included in watsonx.ai? \nThe traditional, non-foundational ML models supported in Watson Studio today will also \nbe supported in watsonx.  \n \nThese include: \n \n\uf0de AutoAI and its many regression, classification, and forecasting models \n\uf0de The hundreds of diverse open-source ML models in the scikit-learn library, along \nwith the deep learning libraries of TensorFlow and PyTorch \n\uf0de Decision Optimization's CPLEX solver \n\uf0de SPSS Modeler's catalog of 50+ ML algorithms \n   \n \n   \n \n\uf0de Watson NLP's suite of models \n\uf0de and many more... \n \nA list of the supported ML frameworks for deployment can be found here.  \n \nIt is widely known that foundation models are expensive to operate (e.g. $700K/day). \nHow will IBM\u2019s platform reduce the entry point for building and tuning models?  \nThe compute infrastructure is the largest cost associated with foundation models. The \nbigger the model, the higher the computation to process input and provide an output. \nThat\u2019s why the cost for a 100+B parameters is high. This is referred to as \u201cusage\u201d or \n\u201cinference\u201d cost and it is measured typically as price per 1K tokens. A token is \napproximately 750 words. You can think of it as asking a question that has 750 words. \nWhen you tune or fine-tune a model, you pay an upfront cost to lower the future \ninference cost. A tuned model will provide more accurate answers. Fine-tuning is very \nexpensive, as it changes the underlying models. Tuning is a more cost-effective \napproach, since you don\u2019t change the underlying model, and create an optimized \nprompt collection that allows the model to provide the output you need.  \n \nOur focus for GA is on providing a more cost-effective approach through tuning, not fine-\ntuning. The issues with current tuning solutions are 1) complexity and 2) efficiency of \nthe tuning algorithm. For example, the tuning stack for Vertex AI is two years old. We \nuse the state-of-the-art Multi-task Prompt Tuning algorithm, paired with an easy-to-use \nguided tuning experience to make it easier for clients. \n \n \n\uf0de Technical \n \nCan I add and use watsonx.ai to build with open-source models or others I have \ncreated? \nYes, you can use the REST APIs and python sdk, which includes a LangChain integration, \nto build powerful AI applications. \n \nWhat data domains and tasks are supported by the generative AI tools in watsonx.ai \nwhether IBM provided the foundation models or I added them? \nWatsonx.ai currently supports two domains: language and code. Foundation models in \nthe language domain can support the following tasks: generation, summarization, \nclassification, named entity recognition, and Q&A. The code domain is currently \nrestricted to an open-source model (codegen-16b-mono), which can be used to write \nand explain code. New models will be added over time, including additional IBM-trained \nmodels. \n \n   \n \n   \n \nWill all foundation models currently in development by IBM Research be available \nin watsonx.ai?   \nIBM Research is actively working on developing foundation models across several \nenterprise domains. Some of these models currently in development will be made \navailable in watsonx.ai.  \n \nThese include: \n\uf0de New additions to the fm.language model family. \n\uf0de Ability to test and tune fm.code models (exclusively for IBM Watson Code \nAssistant Enterprise clients). \nThere are additional foundation models and capabilities in development that will be \nintegrated into IBM products, and may be made available for select partners.  \n \nThese include: \n\uf0de Domain-specific fm.language models (such as bio, finance, cybersecurity) \n\uf0de fm.geospatial models trained on remote sensing data that enable a number of \ndownstream tasks such as flood detection and land use segmentation. \n\uf0de fm.itevents models trained to diagnose and resolve IT issues. \n\uf0de watsonx at the edge, a framework that enables deploying foundation models both \non-premises and across a large number of edge devices.  \n \nAlthough not available yet commercially, it is possible for clients to access these \ncapabilities via a proof of concept (PoC) with IBM Research. \n \nFor more detail, refer to the watsonx.ai model roadmap on Seismic for the latest. \n \nHow and where is the client data used in watsonx.ai? \nClient data is only used for prompt engineering, prompt tuning and fine tuning. IBM will \nnot use client data for any other purpose. Clients retain full control of their data; they can \ndelete it and any fine-tuned models they create at any time. \n \nHow does watsonx.ai manage bias and should I trust IBM\u2019s foundation models? \nIBM\u2019s foundation models are developed, deployed, and validated using IBM\u2019s industry-\nleading best practices in AI Governance. The data used to train IBM models was vetted \nfor legal and safety concerns, and carefully curated by filtering out language reflecting \nhate/abuse/profanity, as well as removing duplicate data (note: duplicate data in the \ntraining set increases the risk of bias). You can learn more about the \u201cblue pile\u201d process \nhere. .  \n \nWe are also working on techniques and capabilities to enhance the trustworthiness of \nfoundation models throughout their lifecycle. We aim to minimize the bias risk in IBM\u2019s \n   \n \n   \n \nfoundation models by training our models on high quality datasets that are vetted for \nlegal and safety concerns, filtered for language reflecting hate/abuse/profanity, and \nduplication. We are also actively researching debiasing techniques that can be applied \nthroughout the foundation model lifecycle from data acquisition, model training and \nadaptation, to post-hoc auditing. \n \nDo watsonx.ai models hallucinate? \nAll generative models have some degree of hallucination (i.e., returning irrelevant or \nfactually incorrect answers). Hallucinations typically occur when prompting a generative \nmodel on a topic that it was not trained for (or does not have sufficient data points in its \ntraining set).  \n \nOne of the best ways to reduce the risk of hallucination is to enable the model to retrieve \nrelevant data related to a user\u2019s query from a knowledge corpus before generating a \nfinal answer. This capability is called retrieval-augmented generation and is an area that \nwe are actively pursuing. In the interim, watsonx.ai users are encouraged to read each \nmodel\u2019s documentation and be aware of its intended uses, risks, and limitations. Users \ncan also tune existing models to perform specific tasks which help to reduce \nhallucination risk. To learn more about hallucination, please see this excellent IBM Tech \nvideo.  \n \nWhere is my prompt data stored, and is it used for anything else? \nClient data is stored in IBM Cloud with strict security and privacy requirements dictated \nby IBM\u2019s CISO that includes fully auditable access records. Client data will never be \nused for model training.  \n \nCan I tune a model in watsonx.ai and deploy it via the API? \nYes, there is a 'Create Tune' API. Once trained, a tuned model becomes available for use \nthrough the GUI and API. \n \nIf I tune a model and deploy it, can I monitor its usage? \nMonitoring is limited to the current user\u2019s session and the history of calls made through \nthe Lab interface by that user. The \u2018History\u2019 API endpoint provides the ability to retrieve \npast generation requests and responses returned by the given models in the past 30 \ndays. Currently, a user cannot monitor another user\u2019s activity.  \n \nCan users import third party foundation models, and will they be stored in the model \ncatalog? \nYes, there are two paths for importing 3rd party foundation models. One way is to import \ndirectly from storage with associated metadata. The other way will be to import models \ndirectly from an integrated vendor (e.g., HuggingFace). There will be an \u201cimport from \n   \n \n   \n \nvendor\u201d feature that will walk the user through picking a model and accepting its license \nterms. In either case, after a model\u2019s license terms are accepted, the model will be \nlisted in the interface along with the other models. At the current time, users cannot \nupload their own models. \n \nAre there accelerators for building new models? \nWe have a pipeline of data pre-processing and model training to accelerate model \ncreation. We use this internally to build all our models; this same stack will be available \nover time to our commercial clients, beyond 2023. There are a few notable deployments \nof this training stack already with NASA for geospatial work, which will be highlighted at \nThink. \n \nIs there a play for Auto AI for foundation model building etc? \nClassic machine learning lent itself well to \u201cexploration-style\u201d approaches to find \noptimal or near-optimal model architectures. Foundation models are different. \nWhile there is an opportunity to use tools, guides, and automation while building FMs, it \nwill look different than the \u201cexploration style\u201d using Auto AI.  \n \nFor example, while building FMs, data cleaning and filtering are essential. The tools that \nautomate and optimize this at scale are major accelerators. We\u2019re in the early days of \nunderstanding which model architectures best fit different problems. There may be an \nopportunity for automation and model customization i.e. how we customize a base \nmodel for the task(s) needed. Right now, it depends on the user knowing what data to \nprovide, how to configure the tuning, and which base model to select. The steps in the \nprocess could lend itself well to automated tuning. \n \nWill clients be able to tune/optimize models?  \nIBM provides approaches and tools to customize models from fine tuning (which is often \nmost appropriate for smaller custom models) to prompt tuning to multi-task prompt \ntuning (a state-of-the-art approach to model customization). These capabilities will be \nin watsonx.ai (Tuning first, fine-tuning later) and are available directly through the \nunderlying APIs. The key in model customization has been to provide the right user \nexperience to guide a user to select which data is needed for customization, how much \ndata, and how to configure the tuning job. \n \nWhere can I find documentation and custom training models? \nSince we aren't offering the ability to train GenAI LLMs at GA in July, specific info for \ntraining models will be released later as part of the tuning studio in watsonx.ai. For the \nWatson Studio NLP LLMs: documentation can be found here in Overview  and in the \ndocumentation here.  \n  \n   \n \n   \n \nAre prompts preloaded with the recommended model type? Can users compare model \nresults side-by-side or receive automated recommendations after testing different \nmodels? \nThe sample prompts will be displayed with the default (and most optimal) model and \nparameters.  However, these can be changed prior to generating responses to \nexperiment with the outcomes.  There is a feature currently in the backlog to add a side-\nby-side output comparison, but it's not likely that this feature will make it into \nproduction by the end of 2023. \n \nwatsonx.data Specific Questions \n \n\uf0de General \n \nWhat is watsonx.data? \nTo scale analytics and AI workloads, organizations are adopting data lakehouses, which \ncombine the performance of data warehouses and the flexibility of data lakes on low-\ncost object storage. Watsonx.data is the industry\u2019s only open data store that enables you \nto leverage multiple query engines to run governed workloads wherever they reside, \nresulting in maximized resource utilization and reduced costs. \n \nBuilt on an open data lakehouse architecture, watsonx.data allows you to access all your \ndata through a single point of entry across all clouds and on-premises environments. \nClients can get started in minutes with built-in governance, security, and automation.  \nWatsonx.data leverages open data formats and low-cost object storage for flexibility and \nsimplicity.  Clients can reduce their data warehouse costs by up to 50% through \nworkload optimization. \n \nWatsonx.data allows clients to take advantage of fit-for-purpose query engines like \nPresto and Spark that optimize workloads for all data types, ensuring fast and efficient \nprocessing for high-performance querying, BI, reporting, and machine learning at scale. \nWith shared metadata and access management, watsonx.data is built to manage the \never-expanding data volumes and most sensitive enterprise workloads on-premises, or \nin the cloud. Supported by built-in integrations with their databases, tools, and modern \ndata stack, clients can leverage IBM\u2019s extensive partner ecosystem, and deep industry \nand technical expertise through IBM Consulting. \n \nHow is watsonx.data unique, first of a kind, or differentiating? \n\uf0de Multi-engine architecture \u2013 Optimize warehouse workloads using fit-for-purpose \nquery engines including Presto and Spark that support all data types and \nworkload needs. Modernize data lakes with warehouse-like capabilities.  \n   \n \n   \n \n\uf0de Governed data across the enterprise \u2013 Protect data, manage compliance, and \nmaintain trust with built in-governance, access controls, and enterprise security. \nIntegrate with IBM watsonx.governance to enable responsible, transparent and \nexplainable data and AI workflows across the enterprise. \n\uf0de Access to all data, anywhere - Deploy anywhere with full support for hybrid-cloud \nand multi cloud environments \n \nWhat is the role of foundation models within watsonx.data? \nFoundation models are used to automate data search, discovery and linking in \nwatsonx.data. Click here for more information.  \n \nWhat is the connection between watsonx.data and IBM\u2019s recent acquisition of Ahana? \nIBM has selected Presto as one of the pillars of its Data Lakehouse infrastructure. Ahana \nis a leading contributor to the Presto engine. IBM acquired Ahana to help make it the \nbest engine for data lakehouses. \n \nHow does the launch of the data lakehouse fit with IBM's data fabric strategy?  \nIBM\u2019s data and AI market leadership, most recently demonstrated by its inclusion in The \nForrester Wave: Data Management for Analytics, extends to watsonx.data by integrating \nwith existing IBM solutions like StepZen, Databand.ai, IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog, \nIBM zSystems, IBM Watson Studio, and IBM Cognos Analytics with Watson. This enables \nusers to utilize various industry-leading data catalog, lineage, governance, and \nobservability solutions across their entire data ecosystem. \n \nWatsonx.data seems nothing more than a rebranding of IBM Lakehouse. What is the AI \nvalue proposition of .data? Will it have any real integration with watsonx.ai? \nIBM Lakehouse was an initial name for our new modern AI repository that supports the \ndata lakehouse pattern. This will now be referred to as watsonx.data as part of the \nwatsonx platform. The three services of the platform (.data,.ai,.governance) are all \nintegrated to provide end-to-end capabilities to support AI builders. \n \nWhere can I learn more about watsonx.data? \nPlease start here in Seismic. \n \nWhat if I have more questions on watsonx.data? \nPlease check out the watsonx.data specific FAQ doc. \n \n\uf0de GTM \n \nWho is the intended user for this product? \n   \n \n   \n \nData Engineers, Data/Business Intelligence Analysts, Data Scientists, Database/Data \nwarehouse admins (DBAs), Enterprise Architects \n \nWhen will watsonx.data be available to clients? \nThe product was announced in beta at Think 2023, but will available via a SaaS offering \nin 3Q\u201923.  \n \nRefer to the watsonx roadmap on Seismic for the latest. \n \nHow and where do clients buy watsonx.data? \nWatsonx.data, IBM Db2 Warehouse, and Netezza Performance Server are offered as \nfully managed SaaS services on IBM Cloud and AWS. They are also available as self-\nmanaged containerized software on Red Hat OpenShift. \n \nDo you have any clients who are currently testing or using the beta?  \nYes, we have 11 clients actively using the beta today with another 16 onboarding. The \nclients range from local government to Fortune 500 companies.  Please reach out to the \nwatsonx.data team directly for more information or leverage this beta enablement deck. \n \nWhat will a client use watsonx.data for? Can you provide 2-3 use cases or examples? \nToday most large enterprises have a mix of data repositories and data stores in hybrid \nenvironments to manage their data and workloads. The overall cost across all these \nrepositories remains high and it has become difficult for enterprises to effectively \nleverage the data across multiple environments and use their data for analytics and AI. \nOrganizations can use watsonx.data to optimize costly data warehouse workloads with \nlow-cost object storage and fit-for-purpose query engines and extract greater value from \ndata in ineffective lakes by modernizing and bringing warehouse-like capabilities.  \n \n1. Access to all data across hybrid-cloud environments  \nShare a single copy of data with tools that can read open data formats to minimize data \nduplication. Connect to and access data remotely across hybrid-cloud with the ability to \ncache remote sources. Deploy seamlessly on-premises and within a managed service on \nany cloud environment. \n \n2. Get started in minutes with built-in governance, security, and automation \nConnect to data in minutes with full-service storage, metastore and engine -- all \nintegrated and preconfigured. Address enterprise compliance and security management \nusing built-in unified governance across your client\u2019s data ecosystem.  \nDiscover, augment, refine, visualize IBM watsonx.data data and metadata in a \nconversational UI experience. \n   \n \n   \n \n3. Reduce the cost of data warehouse storage by up to 50%* through workload \noptimization across multiple query engines and storage tiers:   \nClients can optimize workloads from their data warehouses by taking advantage of fit for \npurpose engines that can scale up/down automatically. Presto and Spark, both of which \nare supported by an Intel processing foundation, offer quick and reliable data \nprocessing for high performance SQL querying, reporting, business intelligence, and \nmachine learning at scale.  Further, this helps reduce costs by eliminating duplication of \ndata utilizing object storage, and helps extract better value from data in ineffective data \nlakes by modernizing and introducing warehouse-like capabilities.  \n \n*When comparing published 2023 list prices normalized for VPC hours of IBM Lakehouse to \nseveral major cloud data warehouse vendors.  Savings may vary depending on configurations, \nworkloads and vendors. (Footnote must remain with claim according to the Legal department)  \n \nWho are the key competitors we are targeting with this solution and how is IBM's \nsolution better for clients?  \nWatsonx.data is the industry\u2019s only open data lakehouse that can run across multiple \nclouds and on-premises. Unlike competitors, it supports fit-for-purpose query engines \nto optimize workloads for both cost and performance at scale.  \n \nKey competitors include: \n\uf0de Snowflake  \n\uf0de Databricks \n\uf0de Dremio \n \nAre you targeting specific industries with this solution? If so, which ones and why?  \nWe\u2019re not targeting specific industries at the moment.  \n \n\uf0de Packaging/Sizing \n \nAre other partners or IBM products involved in the watsonx.data product? If so, how and \nwhat role do they play? \nWatsonx.data will incorporate the latest performance enhancements to the Presto open-\nsource query execution engine via Velox, which is being developed in collaboration with \nIntel and Meta.

It \nprovides enterprises with three key capabilities to govern the entire AI lifecycle: lifecycle \ngovernance, risk management and regulatory compliance. Lifecycle governance provides \nthe capability to monitor the AI lifecycle, including automated visibility of what data was \nused, how the model was built, and any variations on that model. Risk management \nfacilitates the identification and management of risk at scale, and finally, regulatory \ncompliance enables adherence to external AI regulations for audit and compliance \npurposes. \n \nHow is watsonx.governance unique, first of a kind, or differentiating?  \n \nWatsonx.governance is unique in providing a solution that manages AI workflows, \nincluding AI regulation and risk management. This offering provides clients the basis for \npositioning AI outcomes as responsible. \nAs more businesses rely on AI models to execute business strategies, operational risk \nprocesses must be updated to assess risks related to using these models and ensure \nthe appropriate controls are in place. Watsonx.governance ensures that model risk is \nunderstood at the front line of business operations. By aligning models to key business \nprocesses and applications, the organization can highlight the risks that arise from \nModel Development, Deployment and Usage directly with key business stakeholders. \nIt\u2019s a shift from model risk as a siloed view, to model risk in context.  \n \nWith watsonx.governance, organizations can efficiently conduct risk assessments, define \ncontrols to mitigate those risks, and continuously assess control performance. In \naddition to providing model risk governance, watsonx.governance  helps organizations \nmanage operational risks using models supporting the business strategy. The \n   \n \n   \n \napplication also includes the ability to manage regulatory requirements and associated \ncontrols to ensure compliance with AI legislation on both a model-by-model, and in \naggregate approach.  \n \nFirms aiming to provide consistent, trusted service to clients need to factor the growing \nreliance on AI into their resilience posture in the same way they refer to applications, \nphysical assets, vendors, and cloud providers. Watsonx.governance allows them to \nleverage structured AI model risk assessments and AI model monitoring to ensure \nservice delivery to clients and markets.  \n \nWhat services/products are represented by watsonx.governance? What are the product \ncomponents underneath watsonx.governance? \n\uf0de OpenPages  \n\uf0de Factsheets \n\uf0de OpenScale \n \nAre there any new offerings within the rebranded watsonx.governance portfolio, or are \nthese largely pre-existing solutions that have been repositioned under the new \n\u201cwatsonx\u201d naming convention? \nWatsonx.governance is not a rebrand. There will be new capabilities, in addition to the \ncapabilities currently provided by IBM AI Governance.  \n \nWhen is the actual launch of watsonx.governance? If not until next year, will AI \ngovernance and data governance remain separate?  \n \nThe actual launch of watsonx.governance is scheduled for 4Q2023. AI and data \ngovernance will remain separate. As indicated in the definition, watsonx.governance is \ndesigned specifically for the governance of AI lifecycles. \n \nWhy would we announce watsonx governance at Think when it will not be available as a \nsolution until next year?  \nWe announced watsonx at Think, 2023. Watsonx is a single subscription that provides \nusers to access multiple AI capabilities including watsonx.governance. Consequently, \nthe watsonx.governance announcement cannot be decoupled from the overarching \nwatsonx announcement. Watsonx.governance will GA in 4Q2023. The announcement at \nThink will enable sellers to build pipeline ahead of the GA date. \n \nFor more details, refer to the watsonx roadmap on Seismic for the latest. \n \nWhere can I learn more about watsonx.governance? \nStart here in Seismic. \n   \n \n   \n \n \n\uf0de GTM \n \nWho is the intended user for this product/service? \nThe intended user is any client interested in governing their AI workflows for AI lifecycle, \nrisk management and compliance to AI regulation. (Personas include risk managers, \ncompliance and/or information officers, and data scientists). \n \nAren\u2019t there different decision makers and stakeholders for Data and AI? Won\u2019t \ncombining these into a single solution cause sales and marketing challenges?  \nThere are multiple entry points for watsonx.governance opportunities. Sellers will be \ntrained to understand the key personas (Chief Risk Officer for risk management, Chief \nCompliance Officer for compliance, Chief Data Office, Chief Information Officer, and Data \nScientist for model governance). \n \nWhen will watsonx.governance be available to clients?  \nWatsonx.governance is planned for Generally Availability on IBM Cloud as-a-Service in \nNovember 2023. For more details, refer to the watsonx roadmap on Seismic for the \nlatest. \n \nBetween the announcement of watsonx on May 9th and the eventual GA of \nwatsonx.governance, how will we continue to position the existing data fabric use \ncases? \nAfter GA, AI governance will no longer be marketed as a data fabric use case since its \ncapabilities will be part of watsonx.governance. Similarly, Data Science & MLOps will no \nlonger be marketed as a data fabric use case since its capabilities will be part of \nwatsonx.ai. All other data fabric use cases will be positioned as part of the architecture. \n \nWhat are the migration paths for existing clients? \nMigration paths will be determined after packaging for watsonx.governance has been \nfinalized. \n \nWill clients have the flexibility to customize watsonx.governance for specific pain points, \nor are the use cases pre-determined by the watsonx.governance solution? \nWatsonx.governance solves a pain point associated with governing AI workflows. Clients \nwill have the flexibility to use the watsonx.governance toolkit to address AI lifecycle \ngovernance, risk management and compliance with AI regulation. \n \nWhat are our routes to market? \nOur routes to market include Data and AI sellers, IBM business partners, the Amazon \nmarketplace, and digital self-service.  \n   \n \n   \n \n \nWhat will a client use watsonx.governance for? Can you provide 2-3 use cases or \nexamples? \nYes, OpenPages provides out-of-box workflows to help manage: \n \nInventory + Lifecycle Management \n\u2022 Model inventory to track key information \n\u2022 Model candidate workflow \n\u2022 Model development workflows to review and approve new models \n\u2022 Model attestation and related workflow with configurable questions \n\u2022 Model decommissioning workflow to track the retirement of models no longer \nused \n \nRisk Assessment + Model Validation \n\u2022 Model risk scorecard methodology and related workflow to determine model tier \n\u2022 Conduct reviews (validation) of new and existing models and document fieldwork, \nchallenges, and approvals \n \nPerformance Monitoring \n\u2022 Dashboards to give executives a view into the status of the entire inventory of \nmodels and provide actionable insights at a glance \n\u2022 Document metrics and track metric values over time \n \nChange/Issue Management \n\u2022 Track issues and incidents related to models in OpenPages included Issue \nManagement Solution \n\u2022 Workflow to document and approve changes to models \n \nWho are the key competitors we are targeting with this solution, and how is IBM's \nsolution better for clients?  \nTrustible.ai is a new offering, but they don\u2019t have OpenScale or FactSheets functionality. \nThey are going to market with a similar governance-in-process value proposition. \nTrustible.ai and Monitaur.ai are focused on GovernML and RecordML. \n \nAre we targeting specific industries with this solution? If so, which ones and why? \nWatsonx.governance is applicable to any organization and/or industry that leverages AI \nand requires governance of AI workflows. This is a cross-industry solution. \n \n\uf0de Packaging/Sizing \n \n   \n \n   \n \nWill watsonx.governance replace the existing data fabric use cases including data \ngovernance and data integration? \nNo, watsonx.governance is a component of the broader watsonx platform. It is very \nspecifically geared for clients interested in governing AI workflows. Some of the \ncapabilities of the AI governance use case will be incorporated into watsonx.governance. \nSimilarly, some of the capabilities of the Data Science & MLOps use case will be \nincorporated into watsonx.ai. The remaining data fabric use cases will continue to form \nthe architecture for a data foundation that delivers the right data for AI workflows.  \n \nIs OpenScale part of watsonx.governance only, or also under watsonx.ai? If the former, \nare there any changes to the IBM Data Science & MLOps Express offering? \nOpenScale will only be a part of watsonx.governance, not watsonx.ai. No immediate \nchanges are planned for the Data Science & MLOps Express offering (see previous \nanswer).  \n \nIf watsonx.governance is positioned as the lead offering, how do we position the non-\ngovernance capabilities (e.g. data integration, data replication, data observability, \nmaster data management, etc)? \nWatsonx.governance is the next-generation enterprise toolkit to govern AI workflows. \nThe non-governance capabilities will continue to be a part of the data fabric architecture \nthat enables a data foundation that delivers the right data for AI workflows. \n \nSales Specific Questions \nAudience: IBM Sales leads \nPurpose: Seller enablement \n \nWhen will this change be effective for sellers/partners/clients? \nThe change will be effective at the GA of watsonx.ai and watsonx.data in July, with \nwatsonx.governance coming later in the year. \n \nWhere do we go for more information? \nSeismic is continually updated with the latest client-friendly content. Internal comms \nand help will be available on the w3 publisher site. \n \nSeismic: https://ibm.seismicSeismicnk/Content/DCTGRDXWbFqR6G7Wm7pMjjD4V27j \nProduct/Dev publisher site: https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/watsonx \n \nIs there early access for IBMers to try watsonx? i.e., use it to create realistic code? \nWatsonx.ai can be used here  \nWatsonx.data can be used here  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \nWhat does the \u2018x\u2019 in watsonx stand for? \nIt stands for scale.  IBM seeks to help clients to scale AI across their business by \nleveraging Generative AI technology. \n \nWhat is the Unique Selling Point of IBM Foundation Models vs other providers' Foundation \nModels? \nWe've curated our foundation models, so we don\u2019t simply dump everything in one place and \nhope for the best! \n \nHow can I tag a watsonx opportunity correctly in IBM Sales Cloud? \nEach watsonx component has a specific UT30. Type in \u201cwatsonx\u201d in the search bar for product \nidentification and you will see a drop-down of options. Seismic also contains of specific ISC \nguidance assets per component.
