However, there are\ntwo important considerations:\n- The token limit of LLMs still applies. If you keep adding prompts and responses to\nmemory, you can quickly run out of tokens.\n- Cost of tokens if you\u2019re using a hosted instance of LLMs.\n\nLangChain provides several types of memory to help mitigate these issues, such as:\n- `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`: Keeps a list of the interactions in the conversation\nover time. It only uses the last K interactions.\n- `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory`: Keeps a summary of interactions, using token length\nrather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.\n- `ConversationTokenBufferMemory`: Keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and\nuses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush\ninteractions.\n\nThis notebook contains sample code for using `ConversationBufferMemory` with LLM included in watsonx.ai.\nAt the time of writing this lab, WML API supports integration with the most basic memory type, `ConversationBufferMemory`, which keeps the entire conversation in memory until the memory fills or until it\u2019s explicitly cleared."}, {"metadata": {"pycharm": {"is_executing": true, "name": "#%%\n"}}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Install libraries\n!pip install pip install ibm-watson-machine-learning --upgrade\n!pip install langchain | tail -n 1", "execution_count": 1, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "Requirement already satisfied: pip in /opt/conda/envs/Python-RT23.1/lib/python3.10/site-packages (23.3)\nCollecting pip\n  Downloading pip-24.2-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (3.6 kB)\n\u001b[31mERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement install (from versions: none)\u001b[0m\u001b[31m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[31mERROR: No matching distribution found for install\u001b[0m\u001b[31m\n\u001b[0mRequirement already satisfied: jsonpointer>=1.9 in /opt/conda/envs/Python-RT23.1/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from jsonpatch<2.0,>=1.33->langchain-core<0.3.0,>=0.2.27->langchain) (3.0.0)\n", "name": "stdout"}]}, {"metadata": {"pycharm": {"name": "#%%\n"}}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Import libraries\nfrom ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models import Model\nfrom ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models.utils.enums import ModelTypes\nfrom ibm_watson_machine_learning.metanames import GenTextParamsMetaNames as GenParams\nfrom ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models.utils.enums import DecodingMethods\nfrom ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models.extensions.langchain import WatsonxLLM\n\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain\n\nfrom langchain.chains import ConversationChain\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory", "execution_count": 2, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "/opt/conda/envs/Python-RT23.1/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ibm_watson_machine_learning/foundation_models/extensions/langchain/llm.py:60: WatsonxLLMDeprecationWarning: ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models.extensions.langchain.WatsonxLLM is deprecated and will not be supported in the future.
