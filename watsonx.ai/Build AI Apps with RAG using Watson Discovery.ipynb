Watson Discovery uses sophisticated algorithms to determine the best passages of text from all of the documents that are returned by a query. They are displayed as a section within each document query result and are ordered by passage relevance. Including passage retrieval in queries increases the response time because it takes more time to score the passages.\n","\n","* **passages.max_per_document**: One passage is returned per document by default. You can increase the maximum number of passages to return per document by specifying a higher number in the passages.max_per_document parameter.\n","\n","* **find_answers**: By default, Watson Discovery provides answers by returning the entire passage that contains the answer to a natural language query. When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Watson Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query.\n","\n","* **natural_language_query**: Use a natural language query to enter queries that are expressed in natural language, as might be received from a user in a conversational or free-text interface, such as IBM Watson Assistant. The parameter uses the entire input as the query text. It does not recognize operators. The maximum query string length for a natural language query is 2048.\n","\n","For more details on the query parameters, see https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ba64b96d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Utilize the IBM Watson Discovery service to query a collection for information based on a natural language query\n","response = discovery.query(\n","  project_id='<REPLACE WITH WATSON DISCOVERY PROJECT ID HERE>',\n","  collection_ids = ['<REPLACE WITH WATSON DISCOVERY COLLECTION ID HERE>'],\n","  passages = {'enabled': True, \n","              'max_per_document': 5,\n","             'find_answers': True},\n","  natural_language_query = question\n",").get_result()\n","\n","with open('data.json', 'w') as f:\n","    json.dump(response, f)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cae6b7c9","metadata":{},"source":["The next 4 blocks provide some parsing for the output.
