Watson Discovery uses sophisticated algorithms to determine the best passages of text from all of the documents that are returned by a query. They are displayed as a section within each document query result and are ordered by passage relevance. Including passage retrieval in queries increases the response time because it takes more time to score the passages.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **find_answers**: By default, Watson Discovery provides answers by returning the entire passage that contains the answer to a natural language query. When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Watson Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **natural_language_query**: Use a natural language query to enter queries that are expressed in natural language, as might be received from a user in a conversational or free-text interface, such as IBM Watson Assistant. The parameter uses the entire input as the query text. It does not recognize operators. The maximum query string length for a natural language query is 2048.\n",

    "1. **model_type** specifies the LLM being used. In the example below it is the llama-2-70b-chat model. You can change it to other models. Note that the size of the model will have implications on resource usage. You may wish to try some of the other ones in a PoX and see if they will provide different results. In the block below, there are 4 models (with 3 commented out, so llama2 is being used - you can comment out different ones to try). Refer [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-api-model-ids.html?context=wx&audience=wdp), for exhaustive list of models supported.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **min_tokens** specifies the minimum number of output tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **decoding** specifies the decoding method. You can also choose to do **sampling** decoding - in which case you can specify more parameters (such as **Top-P** and **Top-K**). More information on these additional parameters can be found from the Watsonx.ai Technical Sales Level 3 class (https://learn.ibm.com/course/view.php?id=13452).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **temperature** specifies how conservative or creative the model will be. The lower it is, the more conservative it it. The range is from 0 to 2."
